  Create-Haskstar-App 
</h1>



## tl;dr


Automatically build and deploy full-stack haskell WebApps in one command!
Batteries included, even devOps!

The name HaskStar (Hask*) implies building a WebApp with Haskell as a back-end and your choice of front-end, devops, etc.

(Default stack is Haskell/Elm/Postgres, but see roadmap for upcoming options)

#### Currently Very WIP, but I will be working on this full time for a while. Contributions highly welcome!


## Why?

Designed to automate all the redundant, not-so-fun parts of setting up a stack.
This is almost like a framework - monolithic and highly opinionated - 
designed to largely get production ready haskell-based apps up and running quickly!

As all monolithic frameworks come with certain drawbacks (too much magic, difference of opinions on the "right way**, etc**
the eventual goal of this is to make the full setup process highly customizable.


## Setup

--TODO: Work on nix build, homebrew

**NOTE** *You must have docker installed to fully boot the app locally*

If you are on OSX, simply run the following and follow the prompts!
```bash
git clone git@github.com:smaccoun/create-haskstar-app.git
cd create-haskstar-app

chmod +x create-app
./create-app my-app
```

#### --Manual

To manually build
```bash
./build.sh   # Runs stack build and moves binary to local dir

chmod +x create-app
./create-app my-app
```

# Development Philosophy

Major pluggable parts (such as Elm or Miso) will each be kept in a separate repo
that haskstar will build from (e.g. see [haskstar-elm](https://github.com/smaccoun/haskstar-elm)). 
That way these can be used also be used as standalone templates

I am working on this full time and will take a very iterative approach. 
Idea is to get stack working for a certain set of configurations, then continually abstract until nearly anything is plug-in-able
